#  SQL Query Executor

This is a fully frontend-based SQL Query Executor built as part of the **Atlan Frontend Assignment**. It allows users to run and interact with SQL queries through a intuitively designed web interface. The project uses **React + Vite**, and the embedded editor is powered by [**CodeMirror 6**](https://codemirror.net/6/).

## üîß Optimization Techniques

1. **Preload Critical Assets** ‚Äì Fonts, themes, and icons are preloaded for faster LCP.
2. **Lazy Loaded Components** ‚Äì SQL Copilot and export dropdown are dynamically imported with `React.lazy`.
3. **Efficient CSS Usage** ‚Äì Minimized global styles; uses CSS variables and scoped modules.
4. **Custom Font + Preconnect** ‚Äì Inter font is loaded via Google Fonts with `<link rel="preconnect">` for speed.
5. **LocalStorage Debouncing** ‚Äì Query history updates are optimized to reduce re-renders.
6. **Reduced Dependencies** ‚Äì Minimal external libraries to keep JS bundle lean.

## ‚ôø Accessibility Improvements

- All interactive components have proper `aria-labels` or `title` attributes.
- Scrollable areas have `tabIndex="0"` for keyboard focusability.
- The SQL editor uses `role="textbox"` and supports screen reader access.
